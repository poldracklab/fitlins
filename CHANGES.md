0.3.0 (April 19, 2019)
======================

This release restores reports at the second level and higher, and enables isotropic
smoothing with the nistats backend. Reporting has also been refactored to reduce
clutter in the outputs.

With thanks to Karolina Finc, Rastko Ciric and Mathias Goncalves for contributions.

0.2.0 (February 1, 2019)
========================

This release marks a substantial refactoring in the wake of
[BIDS Derivatives RC1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ebopupQxuRwp7U7TFvS6BH03ALJOgGHufxK8ToAvyI/),
[fMRIPrep 1.2.x](https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changes.html#january-17-2019) and
[pybids 0.7.0](https://github.com/bids-standard/pybids/releases/tag/0.7.0).

Reports at second level and higher are currently broken, but we're at a point where neuroscout
is depending on the current code base, the user base is increasing, and it's worth having a starting
point for considering new features.

With thanks to Alejandro de la Vega, Adina Wagner and Yaroslav Halchenko for contributions.
