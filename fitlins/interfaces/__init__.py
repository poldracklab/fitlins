The core functionality of FitLins is organized into Nipype_ interfaces_, which
fall into three primary categories:

* The :mod:`~.bids` interfaces are for interacting with BIDS_ datasets and models_.
* :mod:`~.nistats` interfaces make the Nistats_ estimators available to Nipype workflows.
* :mod:`.visualizations` interfaces wrap matplotlib_, Seaborn_ and nilearn_ to produce
  figures for reports.

Additional :mod:`utility <.utils>` interfaces are available for reshaping and collating
the outputs of interfaces.
